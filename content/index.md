# Knowledge base

---

This website is the developer-creations knowledge base. Here you can find anything from how we deploy websites to quick handy notes.

This website is made with nuxt 3. We used the following modules:

- [@nuxtjs/tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/setup)
- [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/get-started/)
- [nuxt-icon](https://nuxt.com/modules/icon#setup-%EF%B8%8F)
- [@nuxtjs/color-mode](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/color-mode)
